# Super Mario Game
My project is about creating Super Mario Bros game using HTML5 canvas , CSS3, and vanilla javascript.It requires a bit of knowledge related to physics, collision detection, sprite animation,and more !.The storyline is about a plumber named Mario and his brother Luigi travel through the Mushroom Kingdom to save the princess Peach from the evil Bowser.
